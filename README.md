- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Visualize trends over time with color-coded release reasons
- **Excel Export**: Download the complete dataset in Excel format
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Chart updates instantly when filters are changed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation (web application)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd deportation-visualization
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy)

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Installation (Python utility)
Instructions below assume you have python3 and pip installed in your local environment.  See [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for installation instructions.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd deportation-visualization
   ```

2. **Create Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Script**
   
   ```bash
   python3 excel_to_json.py
   ```
   This should output a JSON file in the same directory with the data from the excel sheet specified in the python file.  We add this manually to the data.json used by the app for now. 

When going between the python and node environments, it sometimes thinks I'm still in the python environment (venv) at the command line prompt, so I need to reset the shell environment by running 
```bash
exec "$SHELL"
```

## Data Structure

The application reads data from `src/data.json`. The JSON structure includes:

- **Date**: Monthly data points (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Release Reasons**: Categories like bonded_out, paroled, order_of_recog, etc.
- **Criminality Levels**: Each release reason contains data for convicted_criminal, pending_charges, and other

## Technology Stack

- **React** - Frontend framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Chart.js** - Interactive charting library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **XLSX** - Excel file generation for data export
